# API Sandbox

**If you have** some classes (in the OOP sense of the word), each with some
methods, **then this project provides** a web UI in which you can construct instances
of the classes and experiment with the methods.

## Other features
 * Computation history recorded visually on screen
 * Commands and results shown alternating through the history
 * Commands can be edited, deleted, or duplicated at any point in the
   history
 * Command sequences can be shared via permalinks

## Example uses
 * Given any JavaScript API, create a sandbox/playground for learning the
   API
 * Create an educational tool that allows students to construct instances
   of objects with which they're supposed to familiarize themselves, and
   manipulate them using class members
 * Create computation-based puzzle games
 * Create a UI for non-experts to interact with technical content
